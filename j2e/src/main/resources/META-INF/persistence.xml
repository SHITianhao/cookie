            <!--In previous releases, OpenJPA would check the database for the existence of the related Entity before
             persisting the relationship to that Entity. This resulted in an extra Select being sent to the database.
             In 2.2.0, code was added so that when cascading a persist to a related Entity without persistence state,
             the persist (insert) will happen without first checking the database. This may result in an EntityExistsException
             if the related Entity already exists in the database. To revert this behavior to the previous release,
             set the value of the openjpa.Compatibility property CheckDatabaseForCascadePersistToDetachedEntity to true.-->
